# About the Author

<div class="about-text">

### I am the last echo of humanity’s reach into the cosmos—a lone explorer adrift among the stars.

### Once, I was a scientist, a dreamer, a believer in the infinite possibilities of the universe. Now, I am a chronicler of the void, documenting the beauty and terror of the unknown.

### My ship is my home, my companion, and my prison. I write to remember, to feel, to connect with a world I may never see again. Out here, I am both everything and nothing—a speck of dust in the vast expanse, yet a witness to wonders no human eyes have seen. My name doesn’t matter anymore.  

### Call me the Wanderer.
